# CryptoClustering
**# This week's exercises had us apply learnings of how to create model, fit the model and then predict values.  **
#We used KMeans and PCA to identify the best number of clusters to use and also to identify features that carried the most weight in the model.
**# I utilized the class recordings and activity to complete this weeks challenge.
